Hi I'm Ed, I grew up in Par, Cornwall and after moving further and further east I wound up in London.

Computer programming has fascinated me since I was 11 years old, when my parents brought me a C64. My career in software was ignited when I earned an engineering scholarship through the Royal Academy of Engineering.

My career has spanned several domains, and I am always interested in how things work. I love the variety that software offers.

I now live in Otford, Kent with my wonderful wife and children.
