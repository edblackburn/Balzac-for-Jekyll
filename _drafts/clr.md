Fix Microsoft Development
I was observing Twitter discourse. The malaise on the Windows developer platform is tangible. There is a familiar strain of criticisms. Many of which resonate with my own sometimes bitter experiences. 
I have 16 years experience writing code. Predominantly for the Windows platform. So I am biased towards the Microsoft platform. I am familiar with its strengths and weaknesses. Regardless I am frustrated. My current preference for Windows is because of inertia and familiarity. This is not sustainable for myself. Or the platform.
Microsoft are addressing some frustrations with .NET Core 5 and Core CLR. I fear it is too late for many developers. I don't think that the situation is terminal. But a healthy developer platform ought to translate to a healthy ecosystem and sales. So I'm confident Microsoft's recent efforts to modernise their development stack is sincere.
Below is a list of areas that concern me. I will attempt to explain each one.
